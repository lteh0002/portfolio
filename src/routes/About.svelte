				While I loved the problem-solving aspect of my previous field, I couldn't ignore my growing
				interest in web development. Hence, I taught myself how to code and was soon hooked on the
				creativity and limitless possibilities of the tech world.

				I believe that a website should not only look good, but it should also be functional, easy
				to use, and accessible to all. That's why I strive to create web applications that not only
				look great but also offer a seamless and intuitive user experience.

				I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. If you're
				looking for a web developer who is always striving to improve and bring new ideas to the
				table, then let's connect and have a chat!
